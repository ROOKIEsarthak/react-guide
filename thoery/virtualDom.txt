---> About Create root method

It creates a virtual Dom like structure behind the scenes similar to our project . 
It compares its DOM structre and the projects DOM structure and only changes specific portion in which the change has happened 
and not the like the browser which repaints its complete DOM structure even for some minor changes in the project .
This is the reason behind a browser page reload .


This is the advantage of Virtual DOM .
